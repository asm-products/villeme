## Community of makers

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [assembly.com/villeme](https://assembly.com/villeme).

## The plan

Villeme is a "open startup", where anyone can contribute.
The plan is this: [assembly.com/villeme/plan](https://assembly.com/villeme/plan)

#### How Assembly community works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

## Collaborate


##### Know the current tasks

Go to [assembly.com/villeme/bounties](https://assembly.com/villeme/bounties) and see the tasks and histories to develop 

##### Tips

The best way to collaborate is to "Fork" repo on GitHub.
This will create a copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

Before you set out to improve the code, you should have a focused idea in mind of what you want to do.

Each commit should do one thing, and each PR should be one specific improvement.

#### Forking


	$ git clone



#### Editing and Testing


Ok, you're ready to start editing the code, right?
Not quite!
Before you start editing, you should create a *branch*.
A branch is like an alternate timeline.

You can read more about *git branch* [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell).

If you're trying to fix a bug, you might want to name the branch:
    
    fix-short-description
    
If you're adding a feature: 

    feature-short-description 
    
After you can execute checkout to go the branch
`git checkout -b branch-name`


As far as code style, just try to imitate the style of existing code.
Don't sweat over this too much.
If the maintainer doesn't like how your code looks, they'll suggest changes.

You can set of tests to make sure that the existing functionality of the code stays the same as you make changes.
This helps keep the software stable.


#### Committing and Pushing

`git commit -m "your commit message"`

**Using Your Change:** though it may not be obvious, you can begin using your code in your own projects immediately.


## Getting your Change into the Project

You made your change, tested it, committed it with `git commit`, and want to send it back to the project and have it included in a future version.

To do this on GitHub, you need to submit a "pull request" (PR).


#### Submitting a Pull Request

The golden rule of submitting PRs is to do things the way the project maintainers would want it done.

You can't read the minds of the project maintainers, but you can look at [assembly.com/villeme/bounties](https://assembly.com/villeme/bounties).


#### Submitting a Bug Report (or "Issue")

In GitHub, "Bug Reports" are called "Issues."

Project maintainers really appreciate thorough explanations.
It usually helps them address the problem more quickly, so everyone wins!
